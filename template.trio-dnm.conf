# This config file is intended for use with vr-runner/scripts/run-commands,
# takes a list of candidate DNM sites, runs bcftools/trio-dnm and vrfs and
# creates a tab-delimited list of annotated calls
#
# Usage example:
#   # run commands one by one from the terminal
#   run-commands +config trio-dnm.conf -o outdir -i out.candidates/sites.txt.gz +local
#
#   # run commands in parallel on a farm
#   run-commands +config trio-dnm.conf -o outdir -i out.candidates/sites.txt.gz +loop 300 +mail pd3
